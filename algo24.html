<h4>Exercise class dates</h4>
Mondays, 14:30-16:00 in LAM-2090, starting 15 April 2024.
The exercise classes will be taught by <a href="https://wjturner.co.uk/research">Will J. Turner</a>.

<h4>Office hour</h4>

<h4>Literature</h4>
<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.

<h4>Course content (tentative)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Introduction to algorithmic thinking</li>
	<li>Sorting</li>
	<li>Searching</li>
	<li>Algorithms on graphs</li>
	<li>RSA</li>
	<li>Fast matrix multiplication</li>
	<li>TBA</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise sheets and classes</h4>
After each exercise class, a new exercise sheet will be made available below, except for the first one which will be made available a bit later.
You have one week to solve as many exercises as you can.
However, there is no need to write down your solutions for handing them in (but making thorough notes of your solutions is recommended).
Instead, at the beginning of each exercise class you may indicate which problems on the sheet you have solved.
Then students will be chosen by chance to present their solutions.
Points are not awarded for presented solutions that turn out to be incorrect or incomplete.
If a presented solution is far away from a correct solution, the presenter might be asked to explain some of their other solutions as well.
There will likely be some sort of advantage in the exam for students who solve at least half of the exercises, details will follow soonish.
