<h4>Exercise sheets and classes</h4>
Every Monday, a new exercise sheet will be made available below, starting 8 April 2024. 
You have one week to solve as many exercises as you can.
However, there is no need to write down your solutions for handing them in (but making thorough notes of your solution is recommended).
Instead, at the beginning of each exercise class you may indicate which problems on the sheet you have solved.
Then students will be chosen by chance to present their solutions.
Points are not awarded for presented solutions that turn out to be incorrect or incomplete.
If a presented solution is far away from a correct solution, the presenter might be asked to explain some of their other solutions as well.
